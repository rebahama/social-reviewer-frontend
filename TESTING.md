# Bugs

## Solved bugs
* When I tried to make the user to be able to log out, I ran into some issues where the user would not be logged out when trying to click on "log out". It turned out that I did not match  the url path in the frontend for the API endpoint in the backend. I had forgotten to remove a trailing slash in the front end code and after removing the trailing slash I was able to log the user out when clicking log out.

* When I tried to implement the like feature I could only like the page but not unlike. The console in the browser showed "undefined" id. It turned out that the like_id did not exist in the API endpoint. I had to review the backend code and add the like_id as a methodfield serializer and after that the like function was working and it was possbile to also unlike and the counter would go down.

* In the create review page when choosing categories the API endpoint would display: error:"500 internal error" when trying to sumbit a created review. It turned out that one of the fields where the user can choose a category was empty and the API endpoint would only work if the data was prefilled.
