# Reuse of components
After working with a real project I can now understand why components are effectiv and time saveing in React. I can take an example from my code. If we look at this file here: [Navbarcomponent](https://github.com/rebahama/social-reviewer-frontend/blob/main/src/components/NavBar.js). This file contains alot of code and it is a navbar for a webpage. If I want to display this navbar maybe in another page inside my app I donÂ´t need to write that whole js file again. 

The only thing that I need to do is import and call that component in this format "< NavBar/>" , that line of code will call the whole file that is inside the link and it will display it on that new page. I noticed that when you are working in React and if your writing the same code throughout the page several times, then itÂ´s best to make that code to a component so that you can use that particular code with just one line of code. The code will look cleaner and itÂ´s good for performance.

# Future ideas
 
 * A comment rating system where the user can vote in the comment on how good the review is from 1 to 5. The model and backend for this alredy is completed, the only step is to show it on the frontend.

 * A like system for the profiles, the models and backend for this is alredy created, only the frontend needs to be implemented.

* Add infinite scroll to all the page.

* Add register with email and log in with email.
